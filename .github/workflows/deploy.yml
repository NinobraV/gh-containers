# The idea behind is we run our jobs inside a docker containers.
# note that in most cases, we run the jobs inside ubuntu-latest machine provided by Github and nothing wrong with it

# all the steps of job would be the same result, instead of running job directly on ubuntu-latest machine, we run on docker container.
